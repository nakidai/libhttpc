NAME
     libhttpc - HTTP Library (Cute :3)

DESCRIPTION
     This library provides some QoL function for parsing requests and
     constructing responses.  It's written for making HTTP servers.

     If you want to check the documentation, you may want to check
     include/libhttpc.h file or libhttpc(3)

EXAMPLES
     As an example, I can tell you the way how I personally use this library:

     o	 Receive request from the user

     o	 Pass the request to the libhttpc_loadrequest(3) function

     o	 Handle the request

     o	 Send request back using libhttpc_dumpresponse(3)
